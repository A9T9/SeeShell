# Kantu
Example code for working with the Kantu API. The api is ideal for more complex automation tasks, where a "linear" macro is not sufficient. The API allows you to control all Kantu functions from your favorite programming or scripting language. Note that some "ready to run" VBS and Powershell sample scripts are automatically installed with Kantu. Youn find them in the folder "This PC"/documents/kantu/api
