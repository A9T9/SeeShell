# SeeShell C# API Demo

Visual Studio demo for runtime loading of the SeeShell COM library. Of course, this demo can be used for the "SeeShell" object (= SeeShell Desktop Automation) and the "SeeShell.Browser" object of the SeeShell Chromium Browser for Web Automation. 

Late-binding to COM objects as in this demo means that you do *not*  have to add a reference to the COM library to your .NET project. 

You can download the "Visual Studio C# Demo.zip" ZIP file directly. It contains the complete sample project.
